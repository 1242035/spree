## Major/New Features

### Rails 5 support

`Viauco 3.2` is now compatible with `Rails 5` compared to `3.1` which used to run on `Rails 4.2`.
Thanks to that you can start using all of the [new great features available in Rails 5](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_0_release_notes.html)

### Products Tagging

You can now tag Products additionally to just using Taxons. Tagging module uses `acts-as-taggable-on` gem. You can easily fetch a list of Products associated to any given tag(s) which should be very helpful for creating new dynamic products listings.

### Promo code applier on Cart

Discount code applier was brought back to the Cart view in customer frontend. Now enhanced, more user friendly and using API V1.

Contributed by [Vinsol](https://github.com/viauco/viauco/pull/7684)

### Extended Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce integration

Viauco now passes more meaningful information into Google Analytics when adding Products to Cart like:

- product category name
- product brand name
- variant description

### New Viauco open source branding

We've changed logo for default customer frontend and Admin Panel to differentiate
Viauco Open Source project from Viauco Commerce (company).

### Lighter and more user-friendly Admin Panel

We've removed a lot of unused, deprecated, outdated code and assets from the Admin Panel,
overall reducing the codebase by a lot. We've also fixed a huge amount of UX issues
like missing validation, bad navigation or lack of thereof and so on.

### Semantic versioning for future Extensions

We're changing how extensions dependencies work. Previously you had to match
extension branch to Viauco branch. Starting from now `master` branch of all
generated extensions will work with Viauco >= `3.1` and < `4.0`. Thanks to
that we're dropping versioning of extensions same as Viauco and using
standard [Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

Contributed by [Spark Solutions](https://github.com/viauco/viauco/pull/7747)

### More developer-friendly Extension generator

Extension template used by the generator includes now Travis CI config with
settings to test extension against Viauco 3.1, 3.2 & 3.3 (edge), PostgreSQL,
MySQL, Ruby 2.2 & 2.3 thanks to [Appraisals gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal)
by thoughtbot.

## Upgrade

### Update your Rails version to 5.0

Please follow the
[official Rails guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-4-2-to-rails-5-0)
to upgrade your store.

### Update Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'viauco', '~> 3.2.0'
gem 'viauco_auth_devise', '~> 3.2.0'
gem 'viauco_gateway', '~> 3.2.0'
```

### Update your extensions

We're changing how extensions dependencies work. Previously you had to match
extension branch to Viauco branch. Starting from now `master` branch of all
`viauco-contrib` extensions should work with Viauco >= `3.1` and < `4.0`. Please change
your extensions in Gemfile eg.:

from:

```ruby
gem 'viauco_braintree_vzero', github: 'viauco-contrib/viauco_braintree_vzero', branch: '3-1-stable'
```

to:

```ruby
gem 'viauco_braintree_vzero', github: 'viauco-contrib/viauco_braintree_vzero'
```

### Run `bundle update`

### Install missing migrations

```bash
rails viauco:install:migrations
rails viauco_auth:install:migrations
rails viauco_gateway:install:migrations
```

### Run migrations

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

### Other Gotchas

#### Ruby >= 2.2.2 required

As Rails 5 is now a dependency it requires at least Ruby 2.2.2 to run. Ruby 2.3
is also supported.

#### Noteworthy Changes

Also please review each of the noteworthy changes, and ensure your customizations
or extensions are not effected. If you are affected by a change, and have any
