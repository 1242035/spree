Each major new release of Viauco has an accompanying set of release notes.  The purpose of these notes is to provide a high level overview of what has changed since the previous version of Viauco.

If you are upgrading to a new version of Viauco that is several versions ahead of your current version, it is suggested that you update one version at a time and follow the release notes associated with each update.

You can find the detailed release notes for each version of Viauco using the table of contents on the left hand side of this page.
